# Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)  

### 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **Tire Pressure Monitoring System** that uses a pressure sensor to measure the air pressure inside tires. If the pressure drops below a threshold, a **buzzer alarm** and **serial warning** alert the driver for safer driving.  

### ⚡ Features  
- Real-time tire pressure monitoring  
- Alerts driver of low-pressure condition  
- Prevents tire bursts and accidents  
- Improves vehicle safety and fuel efficiency  

### 🛠️ Components Required  
- Arduino UNO  
- MPX5700 Pressure Sensor (or equivalent)  
- Buzzer  
- Jumper Wires  
- Breadboard  

### 🚗 Applications  
- Automotive TPMS system in cars and bikes  
- Preventive safety in commercial vehicles  
- Smart integration with dashboards
